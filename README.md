# mnist_neural_network
An implementation of a simple feedforward neural network following the [tutorial](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) of Michael Nielsen on neural networks. Since I was following the tutorial, the design and implementation of the neural network is not mine. This neural network is designed to learn how to classify images of handwritten digits.
