# mnist_neural_network
An implementation of a simple feedforward neural network following the [tutorial](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) of Michael Nielsen on neural networks. Since I was following the tutorial, the design of the implementation of the neural network is not mine and there are bound to be similarities between my work and the tutorial. This neural network is designed to learn how to classify images of handwritten digits.
